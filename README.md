# Predict Customer Churn


## Project Description
Author: Dung Nguyen Manh

This is a project to implement best coding practices of a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Python.

## Files and data description
The key files in this project are:
```
.
├── README.md
├── churn_library.py # script to train and analysis the model result
├── churn_notebook.ipynb
├── churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
├── data/  # contains the input data
├── images # analysis save folder
│   ├── eda/
│   └── results/
├── logs
└── models # contains the trained machine learning model

```
You need attention these files:

`churn_library.py`: is a library of functions to find customers who are likely to churn.
`churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`: Contain unit tests for the churn_library.py functions.

## Running Files

Install dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
